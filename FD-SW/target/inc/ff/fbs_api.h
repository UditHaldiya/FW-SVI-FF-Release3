/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
  This function applies for extra non-volatile memory. Extra non-volatile memory
  can to be used for non-volatile data that is not covered by block parameters
  or other standard configuration data.

  A typical value to be stored in extra non-volatile memory is the Total register
  of the IT block. The Total register is a double value (8 bytes) whereas the
  IT block parameter TOTAL is a float value (4 bytes). I.e. the TOTAL parameter
  can not be used to store the Total register value.

  The FB shell provides one extra non-volatile block. This block can be used by
  multiple FF blocks. The FB shell allows to subdivide the extra non-volatile
  block into a maximum of eight sub-blocks. I.e. of maximum of eight FF blocks
  are allowed to announce for extra non-volatile memory.

  During the device startup phase the application has to make sure that all block
  are asked for there need of extra non-volatile memory. The application has to
  summarize the need of all FF blocks and then to apply for the total sum by
  calling fbs_apply_for_extra_nv_ram().

  Currently the IT block is the only standard block that needs extra non-volatile
  memory. In dependance on the application there may be transducer blocks with
  a need of extra non-volatile memory

FUNCTION GLOBAL VOID fbs_set_nv_ram_cycle_time
  (
    IN USIGN32  nv_ram_cycle_time     /* nv cycle-time in seconds */
  )

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to set the nv cycle-time.

  The nv cycle-time corresponds with the resource block parameter NV_CYCLE_T.
  According to the FF specs, NV_CYCLE_T is the time interval for writing copies
  of N-parameters to non-volatile memory. If NV_CYCLE_T is zero N-parameters
  will never be automatically copied to NV memory.

  Previous versions of the FB shell did not support a NV_CYCLE_T different from
  zero. I.e. N-parameters were stored only when they were written via the fieldbus.
  The advantage of this approach was that a new value was immediately stored in
  the NV memory each time it was written via the fieldbus.


  If NV_CYCLE_T is different from zero a new parameter value may be lost if the
  device is powered down within the NV cycle-time interval. To minimize the risk
  of losing non-volatile values, the FB shell sets its NV cycle-time interval to
  be elapsed each time a N-parameter is written via the fieldbus. The elapsed
  NV cycle-time triggers the background task to store all N-parameters that have
  changed in the last NV cycle-time interval. As it take only a few seconds to
  store all modified N-parameters the latest values should be saved when after
  the last write access the device has power for some additional seconds.

  Please set the NV_CYCLE_T carefully! The setting depends on the requirement of
  the application and even more on the type of non-volatile memory available. A
  small NV_CYCLE_T  may destroy an EEPROM in an inacceptable short time!

  In conclusion: if there is no strong requirement for a NV_CYCLE_T different
  from zero, it is recommended to run the FB shell further on with a NV_CYCLE_T
  of zero.

  The call of fbs_set_nv_ram_cycle_time() is optional. If it is not called the
  FB shell will assume a NV_CYCLE_T of zero.

  Please note that the units of 'nv_ram_cycle_time' and NV_CYCLE_T are different.
  The unit of the nv cycle-time is second whereas the unit of NV_CYCLE_T is
  1/32 millisecond.

  )

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to set extra nv cycle-time.

  Similar to NV_CYCLE_T the extra nv cycle-time defines the interval for writing
  copies of extra nv-data to non-volatile memory. If the extra nv cycle-time is
  set to a value different from zero the background task will store all extra
  nv-data changed in the last interval. If the extra nv cycle-time is zero the
  background task will not automatically store the extra nv-data. In this case
  the routine fbs_write_extra_nv_data() must be called to signal to the back-
  ground task that the extra nv-data have to be stored.

  ment of the application and even more on the type of the non-volatile memory.
  A short extra NV cycle-time  may destroy an EEPROM in an inacceptable short time!
  Also the call of fbs_write_extra_nv_data() in a high frequency may damage the EEPROM.

  The call of fbs_set_extra_nv_ram_cycle_time() is optional. If it is not called

FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to allocate one FF-block-specific sub-block of the extra
  non-volatile memory.

  The address returned by this function points to a RAM location that is used as
  image of the extra non-volatile memory. There are two ways to store the data in
  the extra non-volatile memory:

  a) the call of fbs_write_extra_nv_data() triggers the background task to store
     the extra nv-data in the non-volatile memory during its next execution. I.e.
     the extra nv-data are changed within a few seconds after the call of
     fbs_write_extra_nv_data() (immediate storage)

  b) if the extra extra nv cycle-time is different from zero the background task
     will store extra nv-data in the non-volatile memory at the end of the current
     extra-nv cycle-time interval (deferred storage)

  Before the background writes the extra nv-data into the non-volatile memory it
  always checks the data for changes. If the extra nv-data are unchanged the
  background task will not write data into the non-volatile memory.

PARAMETERS

        T_FBIF_READ_DATA       * p_read
      )

    FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
      This function will be called by read handler of the FB shell if a resource
      block parameter with a 'A' or 'X' GenVFD-flag is read.

      As the function block layer handles read accesses to all standard parameters
      it is assumed that the 'A' and 'X' flags are set just for enhanced resource
      block parameters.

      The 'A' flag can be set for parameters that are temporary inconsistent
      or not accessible. Typically the 'A' flag is assigned to dynamic
      parameter that are updated just when they are read. In this case
      a_of_read_hndl_RESB() has to make sure that the parameter is up-to-date
      before it returns. If it is not possible to get an consistent state or value
      a_of_read_hndl_RESB() may return with E_FB_TEMP_ERROR. Please note that
      sporadic denials of read accesses are usually accepted by host systems.
      However, iterated negative read responses are indicated as device errors
      at the system-side.

      A parameter with an 'X' flag is completely under the control of the appli-
      cation. It is not stored by the funcion block layer. When it is called
      a_of_read_hndl_RESB() has to copy the current parameter value to the read
      response buffer. The read response buffer is referenced by the component
      'dest' of the read descriptor. Please note that access by subindex is
      supported. I.e. in case of record or array parameters  a_of_read_hndl_RESB()
      has to check whether the whole parameter or just one component is read.

    PARAMETERS
      p_block_instance      Pointer to the resource block instance

      p_read                Pointer to a read descriptor block

      Please find comments on block instance and read descriptor in file fbif.h

    RETURN_VALUES
      E_OK                  Read access is approved and the parameter is up-to-date
      E_FB_TEMP_ERROR       Read access is not possible at the moment

    FUNCTION GLOBAL USIGN16 (* a_of_write_hndl_RESB)

        T_FBIF_WRITE_DATA      * p_write
      )

    FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
      This function will be called by write handler of the FB shell if a resource
      block parameter with a 'B' or 'X' GenVFD-flag has to be written.

      During the write handling this function is called two times. When it is
      called the first time, the component 'phase' of the write descriptor is
      set to PRE_WRITE_CHECK. In this phase the value to be written should be
      validated. When a_of_write_hndl_RESB() is called the second time, the
      component 'phase' of the write descriptor is set to POST_WRITE_ACTION.

      This phase is intended to perform actions in dependance on the new value.
      Please note that the write handler of the FB shell does not send the write
      response before a_of_write_hndl_RESB() returns from its POST_WRITE_ACTION.
      If complex actions has to be performed it is a good idea to just send a
      message to an other application task. This additional application task is
      intended to have a lower priority than the FDC task. When this additional
      application task receives the message from a_of_write_hndl_RESB() it can
      update the application in dependance on the new parameter value without
      deferring the sending of the write response via the fieldbus.

      A parameter with an 'X' flag is completely under the control of the
      application. Thus, the storage of the new parameter value is a mandatory
      POST_WRITE_ACTION. If the parameter to be written is static, the appli-
      cation has in addition to increment the static revision counter. The FB
      shell provides the fbs_incr_st_rev() routine to do this.

      If the parameter to be written has got no 'X' flag, the standard write
      handler steps - check of the new value,  storage of the new value,
      incrementation of the static revision counter - are done by the write
      handler of the FB shell.

      p_write               Pointer to a write descriptor block

      )

    FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
      This function will be called by read handler of the FB shell if a function
      block parameter with a 'A' or 'X' GenVFD-flag is read. As the function
      block layer handles read accesses to all standard parameters it is assumed
      that the 'A' and 'X' flags are set just for enhanced function block para-
      meters.

      a_of_read_hndl_FCTB() works in the same way as a_of_read_hndl_RESB()

    FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
      This function will be called by write handler of the FB shell if a function
      block parameter with a 'B' or 'X' GenVFD-flag has to be written.

      a_of_write_hndl_FCTB() works analogous to a_of_write_hndl_RESB()

        T_FBIF_READ_DATA *      p_read
      )

    FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
      This function will be called if the block parameter are set to their
      default values and if in the GenVFD script a parameter is attributed
      with the Y-flag. The 'Y' flag indicates that the value from the GenVFD
      script should not be used as default value. In this case the application
      has to provide the default value.

    PARAMETERS
      p_block_instance      Pointer to the block that conains the 'Y' parameter

      p_read                Pointer to a read descriptor. The read descriptor
                            specifies the parameter that needs a default value

    FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
     This function is called when a block is to be instantiated or deleted. By
     returning with TRUE or FALSE the application descides whether the requested
     action is performed or not.

     The application layer has to check instantiate or delete requests carefully.
     Especially - as the function block layer has no chance to check it - the
     application has to check if the request is conform to the CFF file keys
     'NumOfInstantiableBlocks' and 'NumOfPermanentBlocks'.

    PARAMETERS
      block_id          Block identifier generated by GENVFD.
      action            BLK_INACTIVE  An active (visible) block should be deleted
                        BLK_ACTIVE    An inactive (invisible) block should be
                                      instantiated

    RETURN_VALUES
      TRUE              The application agrees with the action
      FALSE             The application refuses the action

    FUNCTION GLOBAL USIGN16 (* a_of_verify_nv_ram) (VOID)

    FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
      This function is called by the background task periodically. The timer
      interval is defined by the first return value of this function (see
      RETURN_VALUES)

      This function is planed to scan the non-volatile memory and, in case of
      a problem, to notify the communication task to report a resource block
      error.

    PARAMETERS
      None

    RETURN_VALUES
      Returns the verification cycle time in 100ms unit. The background task
      stores the return value when the function returns for the first time.
      Afterwards, the background task calls this function every n-times * 100ms.

      The maximum value is 65535 (then the timer interval 65535 * 100ms). A return
      value of 0 requests the background task to stop calling this function

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to write a block parameter locally.

  Please note that this function does not validate the new parameter value.
  An invalid value may lead to incorrect block or device behavior!

  IMPORTANT note on the increment of the static revision counter:

  There is the following FF-890 statement: "the associated block’s static revision
  parameter will be incremented and an update event will be generated each time a
  static parameter attribute value is changed. Also, the associated block’s static
  revision parameter may be incremented and an update event generated if a static
  parameter attribute is written but the value is not changed."

  In general the FB shell will increment the static revision counter each time a
  static parameter attribute value is changed, it will not increment the static
  revision counter if a static parameter attribute is written but the value is
  not changed.

  In GenVFD scripts static parameters are identified by a S- or a V-flag. Because
  of the internal structure of the device data base S- and V-flag parameter has
  to be handled differently to ensure a correct increment of the static revision
  counter:

  S-flag parameters have got an EEP ram image. If an S-flag parameter is written
  the FB shell will compare the block parameter with its EEP ram image. If it
  detects a difference the FB shell will increment static revision counter. If
  the block parameter equals its EEP ram image the FB shell will not increment
  the static revision counter.

  As V-flag parameters have got no EEP ram image the FB shell is unable to compare
  the block parameter with its image. Therefore, for V-flag parameters the FB shell
  compares the locations where the 'source' and 'dest' pointers of the write
  descriptor point to. Usually 'source' points to the receive buffer and 'dest'
  points to the block parameter. In this case the FB shell compares the new value
  (receive buffer) with the actual value (block parameter) and the FB shell can
  handle the static revision counter correctly. However, the comparison of 'source'
  and 'dest' will not work if 'source' is copied to 'dest' before fbs_write_param_loc()
  is called! If it is necessary to copy 'source' to 'dest' in advance the FB shell
  user is responsible for the correct increment of the static revision counter.
  He has to compare the new value with the actual value and in case of a
  difference he has to increment the static revision counter by calling the
  fbs_incr_st_rev() routine.

PARAMETERS

FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
  This function is used to write a block parameter. It is called by the write

FUNCTION GLOBAL USIGN8 fbs_set_block_state
  (
    IN USIGN16  block_id,
    IN USIGN8   action
  )

/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL_DESCRIPTION
  This function may be used to set the active/inactive attribute of a block.

  The default value of the active/inactive attribute of a block is given by
  the input from the GenVFD script. If the GenVFD key BLOCK_INSTANCE is missing
  or set to VISIBLE the block is active by default. If BLOCK_INSTANCE has been
  set to HIDDEN the block is inactive by default.

  This function can be used to overwrite the default value of the active/inactive
  attribute of a block.

  The active /inactive attribute features capability levels. The block list
  described in the GenVFD script is the superset of all capability levels.
  This function allows to update the block list so that it matches the
  implemented capability level.

  In the GenVFD script you may set all blocks to be active. In this case you
  have to disable the unused blocks in the device startup phase. But it is
  also possible to set in the GenVFD script the blocks in the intersection
  of all capability levels to be active. In this case you have to enable the
  blocks completing the capability level during the device startup phase.

  IMPORTANT : The call of this function is allowed during startup phase only!
              It must be called  a f t e r  fbs_check_nv_ram() and
              fbs_apply_for_nv_ram() but  b e f o r e  the execution of
              fbs_start().

  This function works slightly different in device without and with block
  instantiation.

  If block instantiation is not supported then the FB shell does not store
  the active/inactive attribute persistently. I.e. the device will always
  run with the block list described in the GenVFD script and adapted by
  this function.

  If block instantiation is supported then the FB shell stores the
  active/inactive attribute in non-volatile memory. Block instantiation
  means that block activation and de-activation is done remotely via the
  FF bus. To avoid conflicts between the remote and the local settings the
  active/inactive attribute of a function block is taken from the GenVFD
  script only when the device starts with a new configuration: If the
  device starts with a new configuration then the initial function block
  list is build from the GenVFD script and from the settings done with
  this function. If the device re-starts with an existent configuration
  then the FB shell will work with the block list stored in non-volatile
  memory. In case of a re-start the calls of this function are ignored when
  they refer to function blocks.

  Please note: if your device supports block instantiation or has got
  capability levels then the resource block requires the common practice
  parameter CAPABILITY_LEV!
