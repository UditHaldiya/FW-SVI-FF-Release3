/* $History: signalsp.h $
 *
 * *****************  Version 2  *****************
 * User: Arkkhasin    Date: 11/29/11   Time: 2:09p
 * Updated in $/MNCB/Dev/LCX2AP/FIRMWARE/includes
 * TFS:8313 Lint
 *
 * *****************  Version 1  *****************
 * User: Arkkhasin    Date: 11/15/11   Time: 10:57a
 * Created in $/MNCB/Dev/LCX2AP/FIRMWARE/includes
 * Preliminary check-in for
 * TFS:8202 decouple I/O subsystem
 * Not yet ready to package as a module
 *
 * *****************  Version 5  *****************
 * User: Arkkhasin    Date: 7/05/08    Time: 1:33a
 * Updated in $/MNCB/Dev/FIRMWARE/includes
 * sigsp_ConvertSignalToSetpoint yields setpoint in "hard stops" domain
 * (instead of previous convert_... which was aware of ATO/ATC and stops
 * adjustments)
 *
 * *****************  Version 4  *****************
 * User: Arkkhasin    Date: 4/08/08    Time: 6:18p
 * Updated in $/MNCB/Dev/FIRMWARE/includes
 * New NVMEM strategy:
 * Standard-pattern type-unsafe accessors
 * Old-style accessors removed
 *
 * *****************  Version 3  *****************
 * User: Arkkhasin    Date: 3/17/08    Time: 5:07p
 * Updated in $/MNCB/Dev/FIRMWARE/includes
 * Second step toward uniform support of engineering units:
 * Valid range limits for any parameter are owned by a corresponding
 * module and exposed as an array of 2 elements (low and high limits)
 *
 * *****************  Version 2  *****************
 * User: Arkkhasin    Date: 2/25/08    Time: 3:08p
 * Updated in $/MNCB/Dev/FIRMWARE/includes
 * signalsp(_min).h goes by its symbolic name SIGNALSP_H_
 *
 * *****************  Version 1  *****************
 * User: Arkkhasin    Date: 2/01/08    Time: 6:39p
 * Created in $/MNCB/Dev/FIRMWARE/includes
 * Consolidated API for signal to position setpoint conversion
